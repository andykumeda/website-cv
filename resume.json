    "summary": "I've spent three decades building and modernizing enterprise networks in healthcare and high-availability environments. Currently leading the network transformation at Ventura County Health Care Agency, where I'm migrating legacy infrastructure to modern Cisco platforms while ensuring zero disruption to clinical operations. My career has spanned from building global networks at Yahoo during the dot-com era to architecting secure, compliant solutions for healthcare and law enforcement. CCIE certified since 1997—back when there were only a few thousand of us worldwide. I'm drawn to environments where network decisions have real-world impact: keeping emergency rooms connected, enabling secure remote access, or ensuring clinical systems never go down.",
